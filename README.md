Abstract:
 <br>
Finster, Smoller and Yau [[Phys. Rev. D 59, 104020 (1999)]](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9801079) found static, spherically
symmetric localized solutions to the Einstein-Dirac equations called Einstein-Dirac
solitons (EDS). This work considers a modified version of the Einstein-Dirac system
that takes into account a non-zero cosmological constant and a uniform matter
background. We show that EDS occur in this context, and we qualitatively identify
a localization regime bounded above and below by the cosmological constant. The
formation of EDS as a phase transition between a state of uniform energy density
and one where fermions condense out in localized structures constitutes a promising
analogue to particle generation in the early universe. We introduce a model that
utilizes EDS to reproduce a uniform matter background and that can be used to
investigate their formation.
